{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'X', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'R'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Mystery Swamp.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'T', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'O'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Tall Tree Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'P', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'O'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Tall Tree Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'T', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'H'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Three Peak Mountain.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'Y', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'S'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Purple Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'F', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'I'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Tall Tree Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'V', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'T'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'K', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'P'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Purple Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'I', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'X'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'R', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'E'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Mystery Swamp.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'Z', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'P'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'U', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Z'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Tall Tree Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'E', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'F'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'X', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'N'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Hanging Vine Jungle.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'A', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'H'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'H', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'A'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Green Hill Meadow.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'E', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Q'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'J', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'W'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Blue Mountain Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'O', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'P'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'G', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'O'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Green Hill Meadow.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'F', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'I'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'A', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'G'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Stone Hill.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'J', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'V'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'H', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'X'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Purple Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'V', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'S'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'Z', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'D'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Hanging Vine Jungle.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'J', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'M'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'S', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'G'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Three Peak Mountain.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'E', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'W'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'C', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'E'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Three Peak Mountain.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'H', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'A'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Tall Tree Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'U', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'T'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Sunrise River.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'T', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'G'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Redwood Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'R', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'D'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Stone Hill.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'U', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'H'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Three Peak Mountain.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'T', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'I'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Redwood Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'Q', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'L'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Coconut Beach.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'X', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'J'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'P', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'V'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Tall Tree Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'P', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'E'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'W', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'K'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Stone Hill.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'I', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Y'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'K', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'P'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Trim Tree Woods.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'O', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'M'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'D', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'T'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Purple Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'D', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'E'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'Q', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'W'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Purple Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'U', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'O'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'T', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Z'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Dusk Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'I', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'B'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'H', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'W'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Tall Tree Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'F', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'E'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'F', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Z'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Pink Mountain Valley.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'U', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Q'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'J', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'O'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Coconut Beach.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'V', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'K'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'K', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'E'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Purple Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'R', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Y'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Trim Tree Woods.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'B', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'I'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Coconut Beach.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'X', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'P'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'P', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Q'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Green Hill Meadow.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'V', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'M'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'U', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'B'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Green Hill Meadow.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'G', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'B'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'D', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'H'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Pink Mountain Valley.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'H', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Z'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'S', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'C'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Three Peak Mountain.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'C', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'D'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'L', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'J'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Blue Mountain Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'K', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'G'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'P', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'W'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Dusk Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'A', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'V'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'S', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'V'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Sunrise River.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'V', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'G'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'B', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'R'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Sunrise River.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'N', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'F'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'P', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'N'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Coconut Beach.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'K', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'R'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'R', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'J'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Hanging Vine Jungle.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'J', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'C'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'S', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Q'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Redwood Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'R', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'N'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'F', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'E'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Blue Mountain Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'Z', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'C'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'B', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'W'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Trim Tree Woods.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'E', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'D'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'B', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'T'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Mystery Swamp.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'V', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'E'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'C', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'T'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Blue Mountain Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'G', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'N'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'F', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'L'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Mystery Swamp.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'Q', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'T'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'W', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'U'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Redwood Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'A', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'H'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'M', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Y'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Coconut Beach.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'H', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'R'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'Z', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Y'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Hanging Vine Jungle.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'A', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'F'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'S', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Q'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Dusk Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'K', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Z'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'M', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'U'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Redwood Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'E', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'X'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'C', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'R'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Green Hill Meadow.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'U', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'M'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'O', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'L'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Trim Tree Woods.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'S', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'H'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'H', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'C'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Purple Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'C', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'E'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'W', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'C'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Sunrise River.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'L', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'W'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'Z', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'J'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Dusk Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'K', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'B'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'N', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'F'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Mystery Swamp.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'X', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'S'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'L', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'E'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Sunrise River.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'C', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'G'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'J', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'A'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Purple Lake.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'H', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'K'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'H', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'I'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there. (out of three rounds a coin was found between the sunflowers in two rounds)\n At the end of the testing session you'll be awareded a bonus based on the number of coins you collect.\n You are ready to start!\n\n You have entered Tall Tree Forest.

{"text": "Welcome to the Enchanted Kingdom\n Once upon a time, in a far corner of the world, an enormous earthquake separated the Enchanted Kingdom in half.\n In order to unite the kingdom, a large bridge needs to be built to connect the now separate land masses.\n The King and Queen need your help to raise money to help build the bridge.\n They have asked you to collect coins from regions around the kingdom until there is enough money to build a large bridge.\n Every region is owned by a magical creature, that has its own favorite spots to hide coins.\n Each creature hides their coins in 3 different hiding spots.\n You will see two hiding spots at a time and have to choose which hiding spot the creature likes best.\n Your goal is to collect as many magical coins as you can in order to build the bridge and unite the kingdom.\n Every round you will be shown 2 potential hiding spots and asked to pick one. Some spots will have lots of coins and others might have less.\n Hiding spots appear on the left or on the right totally at random. Position does not affect whether or not you will find more coins from a hiding spot.\n The background shows you what region you are in, with the creature that lives there located on the right corner.\n This will help remind you which region you are currently visiting.\n You can select the hiding spot on the left by pressing 'P', or the hiding spot on the right by pressing 'Z'.\n Once you select a hiding spot, you will see if you have found a coin or not.\n Remember, each hiding spot has its own number of coins.\n You should try to figure out which hiding spots are the creature's favorite so you can collect the most coins.\n You can collect one coin at a time.\n It is important to remember that every creature has a hiding spot it likes most. Even if the hiding spots look the same in different regions, not every creature likes the same hiding spot.\n The gnome might love rocks and will hide more coins there, while the elf might prefer the pumpkin patch and hide more coins over there.\n Here is what you might expect in a hiding spot that looks the same in two different regions.\n - The badger doesn't like sunflowers so he hid a small amount of coins there (out of three rounds, only in round one a coin was found in the sunflowers.)\n - While the fox loves sunflowers so he hid many coins there.
